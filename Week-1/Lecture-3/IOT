In this lecture, I delved into the principles of frontend and backend development and their interaction within a web application. The frontend, which manages the user interface, communicates with the backend, where server-side logic is executed and database connections are managed. This architecture can incorporate multiple backends and servers to improve scalability and performance. We specifically focused on using React for constructing the frontend, Node.js and Express.js for handling backend operations, and MongoDB for database management. This holistic approach ensures a thorough understanding of how various components collaborate to develop dynamic, efficient web applications.
